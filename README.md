# DIPE Visualizer

Interactive HTML visualization of displacement-induced phase error (DIPE) in reflection-mode interferometric imaging.
The DIPE concept was proposed in the PRESIR paper (Li et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 2025), which focuses on FD-OCT but applies broadly.

## Use

### GitHub Pages
Open https://NTU-Ling-lab.github.io/dipe-visualizer/.

### Local
Download `index.html` and open it in a modern browser (such as Chrome, Safari, and Edge). No build or dependencies required.

## What it shows
- Coherent sum of scatterers under an axial PSF.
- Phase measured from the coherent sum of scatterers vs phase directly converted from the bulk displacement, and the corresponding phase error.
- Amplitude and phasor views for intuition.
