# Displacement-induced Phase Error (DIPE) Visualizer

Interactive HTML visualization of displacement-induced phase error (DIPE) in reflection-mode interferometric imaging.
The concept of DIPE was proposed in Li et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 58, 145102 (2025), which focuses on FD-OCT. DOI: 10.1088/1361-6463/adb3b4

## Use

### GitHub Pages
Open https://ntu-ling-lab.github.io/dipe-visualizer/.

### Local
Download `index.html` and open it in a modern browser (such as Chrome, Safari, and Edge). No build or dependencies required.

## What it shows
- Coherent sum of scatterers under an axial PSF.
- Phase measured from the coherent sum of scatterers vs phase directly converted from the bulk displacement, and the corresponding phase error.
- Amplitude and phasor views for intuition.
